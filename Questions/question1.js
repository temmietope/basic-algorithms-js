/**
 QUESTION
All the students taking a module have filled in a questionnaire which contained 10 questions. Each question was answered with the same scale:
Strongly Disagree [ ] Disagree [ ] Neutral [ ] Agree [ ] Strongly Agree [ ]
The students answers have been coded from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree) so that the 10 answers from each student are coded as 10 numbers from 1 to 5. This data is now ready to be analysed.

You are to write a program to read and analyse the data from 50 students. The students' answers are to be given scores [-5, -2, 0, 2, 5] so that "Strongly Disagree" is scored -5 and "Strongly Agree" is scored 5.
The average score for each question should be calculated and reported. Finally, the question with the lowest total score should be reported**/


const gradeEachStudent = (studentsData)=>{
    for (let student = 1; student <= 50; student++) {
        for (let question = 1; question <= 10; question++) {
            
        }
      }
}
const gradeQuestionnaire = studentsData => {
  let scorePerOption = [-5, -2, 0, 2, 5];
  
};
